#**Gutzwiller Ansatz for the Bose-Hubbard model**

The Gutzwiller wave function is constructed by applying a Gutzwiller projection operator to a
product state of single-particle orbitals, which effectively suppresses double occupancy of elec
tronic states. The projection operator acts on each lattice site and reduces the probability of twoelectrons occupying the same site due to strong electron-electron repulsion.

 In its most basic form, this method relies on approximating the many-body wave function by multiplying individual site contributions:
 
 $$\ket{\Psi}=\prod_i\sum_{n=0}^{n_{max}} f_{n_i}^i \ket{n_i}$$
